When: Sprotty was first released in 2017 and has since been continuously developed and improved by the community of contributors.
<br><br>
Why: Sprotty makes it easy to create beautiful, interactive diagrams in web applications, with the ability to customize and integrate with external tools and services. It provides a flexible and extensible framework that can be used for a wide range of diagramming needs, from simple flowcharts to advanced graphical editors that integrate with external services. With Sprotty, developers can save time and effort in creating powerful diagramming tools for their applications.
